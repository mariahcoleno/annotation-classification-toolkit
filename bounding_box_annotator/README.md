## Bounding Box Annotation Tool
This project serves as a technical case study demonstrating image annotation workflows, structured AI data generation, and human-in-the-loop data preparation for machine learning systems.

The tool provides a GUI-based workflow for creating labeled image datasets by drawing bounding boxes around objects, assigning labels, and exporting structured annotations for downstream machine learning workflows.

### Features
- Draw bounding boxes around objects in images via Tkinter GUI
- Assign text labels to annotated objects
- Save annotations and navigate between images
- Export annotations to CSV format

## Technical Purpose
This tool was designed to support AI model development workflows by enabling:
- Creation of structured training datasets through manual annotation.
- Consistent labeling workflows for computer vision tasks.
- Export of labeled data for downstream machine learning pipelines.
- Human-in-the-loop quality control during dataset preparation.

### Files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the tool.
- `setup_db.py`: Initializes SQLite database (`bounding_box_db.sqlite`).
- `load_images.py`: Loads images from `images/` into database.
- `annotate_boxes.py`: GUI to draw boxes and label objects.
- `export_boxes.py`: Exports annotations to `bounding_boxes.csv`.
- `bounding_box_db.sqlite`: Generated SQLite database (ignored by Git).
- `bounding_boxes.csv`: Exported annotations (ignored by Git).

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+ (tested with Python 3.13.3)
- Pillow (PIL) - for image processing

### Setup and Usage 
#### Option 1: From GitHub (First Time Setup)
- **Note**:
  - Start in your preferred directory (e.g., cd ~/Desktop/ or cd ~/Downloads/ or cd ~/Documents/) to control where the repository clones. 
  - If you skip this step, it clones to your current directory.
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mariahcoleno/annotation-classification-toolkit.git`                                      
2. Navigate to the bounding_box_annotator directory: `cd bounding_box_annotator/` (from the root of your cloned repository)
3. Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Prepare the shared images directory:
   - Create shared images directory if it doesn't already exist: `mkdir -p ../image_annotator/images/`
   - Ensure images are in `../image_annotator/images/` (relative to `bounding_box_annotator/`).
     - If images already exist from a prior image_annotator setup: Use those.
     - If adding new images, copy your images to the directory: `cp /path/to/your/images/*.jpg ../image_annotator/images/`
     - **Note**: This repo doesn't include sample images. You can use datasets like Kaggle's "Cats vs. Dogs" or your own images. For help, see Tips below.
7. Proceed to the "Run the Tool" section below.

#### Option 2: Local Setup (Existing Repository)
1. Navigate to your local repository: `cd ~/Documents/annotation-classification-toolkit/` # Adjust path as needed
2. Navigate to the bounding_box_annotator directory: `cd bounding_box_annotator/`
3. Setup and activate a virtual environment:
   - If existing: `source venv/bin/activate` # Adjust path if venv is elsewhere
   - If new: 
     - `python3 -m venv venv`
     - `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies (if not already): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Prepare the shared images directory:
   - Create shared images directory if it doesn't already exist: `mkdir -p ../image_annotator/images/`
   - Ensure images are in `../image_annotator/images/` (relative to `bounding_box_annotator/`).
     - If images already exist from a prior image_annotator setup: Use those.
     - If adding new images, copy your images to the directory: `cp /path/to/your/images/*.jpg ../image_annotator/images/`
     - **Note**: This repo doesn't include sample images. You can use datasets like Kaggle's "Cats vs. Dogs" or your own images. For help, see Tips below.
6. Proceed to the "Run the Tool" section below.

### Run the Tool (Both Options):
1. Initialize the database: `python3 setup_db.py` 
2. Load images from ../image_annotator/images/: `python3 load_images.py` 
3. Draw bounding boxes around objects in the image and label objects: `python3 annotate_boxes.py`
4. Export annotations to bounding_boxes.csv: `python3 export_boxes.py`

### Results
- Example Output (bounding_boxes.csv):
  ```csv 
   file_path,x1,y1,x2,y2,label
  ../image_annotation/images/cat.6.jpg,70,222,301,459,Cat box
  ../image_annotation/images/dog.36.jpg,107,90,473,535,Dog box 
  ```

x# Tips
- To find your image path and copy your images to images/:
  - Option 1: Use a Separate Terminal
    - Open a new terminal window or tab.
    - Navigate to your images directory: `cd ~/Downloads/` (adjust as needed).
    - Run `pwd` to get the path, e.g., `/Users/yourusername/Downloads/`
    - Copy that path. Then go back to your original terminal (still in image_annotator/), and use it in the cp command.
  - Option 2: Use your File Explorer
    - On macOS, right-click a file in Finder, hold the Option key, and select "Copy [filename] as Pathname" to get the full path.
    - On Windows or Linux, you can drag the folder into the terminal to see its path.
    - Use that path in the cp command without leaving image_annotation/.
  - Option 3: Type the Path Directly
    - If you already know where your images are (e.g.,`~/Downloads/`), just use that in the cp command.
    - You can also start typing the path in the terminal and use tab completion to fill it in.

### Development Notes
- AI-assisted development tools (Claude and Grok) were used to accelerate prototyping, debugging, documentation, and implementation.
- As project lead, I directed the workflow design, data annotation strategy, and technical implementation decisions.
